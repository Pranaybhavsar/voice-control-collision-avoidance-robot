# Voice-control-collision-avoidance-robot
 The main aim of the robot is to scan the voice input and process it for 
required operation by controlling the robotic vehicle via voice 
command.

• The voice control technique consists of an Android app which 
communicates with the robot via Bluetooth module.

• Additionally the robot will also have the proficiency to detect the 
obstacle and notifies the user to avoid the obstacle by automatically 
stopping the vehicle with the help of Ultrasonic sensor.

• Infrared sensor is also used at backside to avoid collision when moving 
backwards.

Components Used:-
1)arduino uno
2)ultrasonic sensor
3)infrared sensor
4)servo motor
5)l293d motor driver ic
6)bluetooth module

 Task of the Robot:-
 
• When the robot gets power supply, the robot starts to move with the 
voice commands.

• When the obstacle comes in front of robot and also back of the robot, it 
senses the obstacle and stops.

• Then the robot waits for the user to provide the next command. 4. The 
command of the user are “forward”, “backward”, “left” and “right”. 5. 
Depending upon the command given by the user, the robot works 
according to it.
